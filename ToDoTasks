To do
=====

1. The RATL.css file is not required but is a placeholder if you want
to move the css styling out of the html page itself.  This was tried,
but for some reason, the .ui-page background color does not get applied
when moving out to a separate stylesheet (something related to JQuery).

2. Potentially changeable text should be pulled out of the main page and
instead loaded from an structured resource of some kind.
